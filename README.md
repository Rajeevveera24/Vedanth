# Vedanth

This was a team project I worked on for an the event Vedanth during my college fest.

We developed an autonomous bot capable of following and solving a line maze. The sensors and motors of the bot were programmed using an arduino nano.
The bot uses the simple right hand wall algorithm to solve the maze.

There is also a graphical simulation (built using turbo c++) which shows the motion of the bot (In the simulation, the bot follows the left hand wall algorithm). The bot is depicted by red dot in the simultion. Ultimately, we're able to find the shortest path from the start to the finish.
To run the simulation, you will need to install turbo c++ and copy the egavga.bgi file to the same folder as the program.
